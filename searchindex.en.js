    "content": "Overall Structure There are 3 mandatory assignments, to be done in alone, worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits) in total.\nThe main objective of the assignments is to exercise the theoretical knowledge gained in the lectures. You are to hand in the code and a report. The code should follow the coding convention and the report must follow the structure and content of the demo report\nFor each assignment, the assistants supervise 3 help sessions for troubleshooting in the preparation of your reports.\nEach assignment has 2 independent problems, each yielding a problem score in $0..5$, hence there is a maximum of 30 points to earn. For each problem, a skeleton code in Python 3 with test cases is provided. Insufficiently good reports can be defended orally to an assistant in scheduled grading sessions. Solutions are discussed by the assistants in solution sessions.\nSubmission Requirements You must submit :\nYour report All relevant python files. You must not change the API or function signatures. If you do this, then we cannot run the automated testing and you will receive a mark of 0. The skeleton code comes with an extensive set of test cases. Your submitted code must pass all test cases. If you code does not pass all test cases, then we will not read your report and you will receive a mark of 0 for that part of the assignment. Your implementation should be correct, and if it is correct then you should be able to pass all the provided test cases.\nHelp Sessions The objective of a help session is only for the assistants to help you prepare an acceptable solution for the assignment with the closest upcoming deadline. Also, the necessary course material will normally have been presented in lectures at least a week prior to the first help session. You are thus able and even strongly encouraged to prepare your solution as far as possible until the help sessions and to attend them, in order to make best use of that reserved time span of personal attention by the assistants.\nSolution Session The objective of a solution session is only for the assistants to discuss acceptable solutions to the assignment of the previous deadline. No code will be handed out. The first two solution sessions are merged with the initial help sessions to the next assignment. For timetable reasons, the third assignment has no solution session.\nComments on your submitted report can be found on Studium; more detailed comments can be obtained orally from the assistants upon appointment.\nSubmission and Deadlines All assignment reports, with imposed structure must be submitted electronically via Studium, whose clock may be different from yours. Submission deadlines are hard. Grading will only start after a deadline, so you can submit multiple times until then.\nEthics Please see the Ethics Guidelines in the FAQ.\nWe reserve the right to give different assignment scores to the teammates of a team, depending on the performance at the grading session.\nPlease report any problems within a team to the head teacher, who will handle the case in confidence, in the best interest of both teammates, keeping the ethics dimension in mind.\nExpected Effort One higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average student. Hence 133.33 hours are expected on this 5-credit course.\nThe assignments are worth 2 credits in total. Not counting the 19.5 hours spent on the 13 lectures, the 3 assignments are calibrated to take an average of 30 hours each, for the average student, for each teammate, including the corresponding help, grading, and solution sessions, and this time counts also as exam preparation.\nAll this does not clash with other courses you are taking, as university studies are legally defined to take 400 hours of work per study period (normally 10 weeks), and the standard 15 credits targeted in a study period are calibrated to reach that total.\nDo not expect the 3 assignments to be equally labour-intensive, and do not expect the 2 problems of each assignment to be equally labour-intensive. Assignment 3 is calibrated somewhat shorter due to the proximity of the exam.\nFormer Students Students from previous academic years who have not yet been awarded the credit point(s) for the assignments contact the head teacher.",

    "content": "Assignments The three assignments are worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits). The assignment grade is as follows when $a_i$ is your final score (out of 10) on Assignment $i \\in 1..3$, and $a = a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ is your total score. Each assignment is divided into two Problems with sub parts. On each of the problems you must have a score of at least 1 (out of 5) to pass the course. If you have a 0 on any of the two problems any assignment, then you will fail the assignments.\nYou must earn at least 3 points (of 10) on each of the assignments.\nGrade Condition 5 $a \\in \\\\{25\\ldots 30\\\\}$ 4 $a \\in \\\\{20\\ldots 24\\\\}$ 3 $a \\in \\\\{15\\ldots 19\\\\}$ Exam The exam is worth 3 higher-education credits (ECTS credits). The exam is marked out of 20. The exam is constructed in such a way to have no marks that are fractions of a point. The following table gives your grade assignment. Let $e$ be your total exam score:\nGrade Total Score 5 $e \\in \\\\{17 \\ldots 20\\\\}$ 4 $e \\in \\\\{14\\ldots 16\\\\}$ 3 $e \\in \\\\{10\\ldots 13\\\\}$ U $e \\in \\\\{0\\ldots 9\\\\}$ Note that previous instances of the course and versions of this web-page had the exam marked out of 30. At some point actual exam was re-scaled to have 20 questions, with each question being worth 1.5 points. To get to the original scale some rounding up or down (usually up and in the student favour) had to be done. This new version of the table is much simpler and gives the student the same marks as before.\nOverall Grade The overall grade is a weighted sum as follows when you have earned the assignment credits with total score $a=a_1+a_2+a_3$ (out of 30) and the exam credits with score $e$ (out of 20), following table gives the overall grade:\nGrade Condition 5 $2\\cdot a + 3\\cdot 1.5 \\cdot e \\in \\\\{121\\ldots 150\\\\}$ 4 $2\\cdot a + 3\\cdot 1.5 \\cdot e \\in \\\\{96\\ldots 120\\\\}$ 3 $2\\cdot a + 3\\cdot 1.5 \\cdot e \\in \\\\{75\\ldots 95\\\\}$ Note that you must pass both the assignments and the exam to get a final grade. If the resulting grade is lower than your exam grade, then the overall grade is the exam grade.\nNote that the extra factor of $1.5$ for the exam grade is to calibrate a 20 point exam to a 30 point exam. Future version of this course web page will simply recalibrate the intervals, but I have left them this year (2020) in order not to confuse students.",

    "content": "Before contacting anyone for help, please check whether your question has an answer in the FAQ list below. If not:\nIf you have a question about the lecture material or course organisation, then contact the head teacher.\nIf you have a question about the assignments or infrastructure, then contact the assistants at a help or solution session for an immediate answer. Short clarification questions (that is: not about programming issues) that are emailed to the AD2 helpdesk are answered as soon as possible during working days and hours. No answer means that you should go to a help session: almost all the assistants’ budgeted time is allocated to grading and to the help, grading, and solution sessions.\nEthics Plagiarism The legislation on plagiarism and cheating and Pierre Flener’s summary of Uppsala University will be rigorously applied, without exceptions. This disallows using a public repository (such as GitHub), where you should use a free private student repository for code management. We reserve the right to use plagiarism detection tools and point out that they are extremely powerful.\nEthics The use of LLMs and Code Assistants On this course you are not allowed to use LLMs or coding assistants when doing your assignments. Explicitly: LLM coding assistants when writing your code, and no use of generative AI for your report. You are allowed to use tools such as grammar checkers to improve your report. All the the work should be completely your own.\nThe only way to master material in the course is to think and implement the solutions yourself. LLMs are useful only when you can understand the code that they produce.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and Answers A. Generalities Will I get rich after passing this course? Some of the wealthiest people on the planet made their fortunes from clever algorithms and data structures, witness Sergey Brin and Larry Page, inventors of the Google web search engine (valued at many gazillions of sek). Some of the wealthiest people in Sweden studied at Uppsala University and went on to develop software needing clever algorithms and data structures, witness some of the founders of OnGame (acquired by bwin for about 4.5 billion sek), MySQL (acquired by Sun Microsystems for about 6.3 billion sek), and Skype (acquired by eBay for at least 17 billion sek). There is no limit to the need for efficient algorithms and data structures.\nWhat are the practical applications of the discussed algorithms and data structures? Most batches of slides list a lot of practical applications. Each algorithm and data structure has an abstract name so that one does not risk thinking its scope is restricted to a particular application.\nWhy all this theory in the course? Why is it at the beginning of the course? Is it useful? In order to discuss in a scientific way the relative merits of alternative algorithms or data structures for a given purpose, we need an analytic way of predicting their performance, rather than experimentally and inaccurately measuring it in milliseconds or bytes. The (few!) notions seen are among the most celebrated of computing science and will transcend the rest of your studies as well as any programmer career.\nWhy are there not more examples and solved exercises in lectures? Like every course, AD2 has a required theoretical content (which is not decided by the head teacher) and the standard time budget (students are 33% fulltime on AD2, and no teacher is anywhere near fulltime on AD2): the balance of theory and practice in the lectures simply follows from these data and is not a sign of our bad will. On the contrary, if allocated more time (but this is impossible), then we would love to offer additional practical problem solving sessions.\nB. Assignments, Help Sessions, Grading Sessions, and Solution Sessions Why are there not more assistants? Why are there not more examples and solved / supervised exercises by assistants in lessons? Like every course, AD2 has the standard time budget (students are 33% fulltime on AD2, and no teacher is anywhere near fulltime on AD2): the number of scheduled events simply follows from these data and is not a sign of our bad will. On the contrary, if allocated more time (but this is impossible), then we would love to offer additional practical problem solving sessions.\nHow do I best use my time, and yours, in order to solve an assignment? Prepare your solution as far as possible until the corresponding help sessions, in order to make best use of that reserved timespan of personal attention by the assistants. This is much more effective than going to a help session, printing out the assignment (which was published at least a week before the first help session and often does not require any material taught in the meantime), and not meeting all the difficulties until the end of the two session hours.\nWhy is there not more email support for the assignments? We have scheduled almost all the standard time budget for the lectures, help sessions, grading sessions, solution sessions, grading, and preparation. This is why we can only answer to emailed short questions that trigger brief reply times, and this is a more personal and rational way of spending the standard time budget: more email support would inevitably result in fewer help sessions.\nI am lost! Why do the assignment instructions not tell us how to solve the questions? Stating only what output has to be computed from the inputs is a pedagogical choice. In real-life engineering problems, you are not asked to solve a problem by using method m on page p of textbook t. Come to some of the help sessions of an assignment in order to get advice on what is wrong with your current solution or get hints on how to proceed. If you think a programming task is insufficiently described in terms of its pre- and post-conditions, then contact the teachers: we vet problem descriptions with utmost care and no flaws are due to purpose or sloppiness.\nWhy are the assignment questions neither in sync with the lecture contents, nor closer to them? See the previous question. The assignment questions are at most within the order of difficulty of the questions tackled in the lectures, and the lecture material helps in solving them, but the data structures and algorithms to be designed in assignments are new compared to the lectures, and they have been selected as examples of the infinite variety of interesting algorithmic questions that occur in real life.\nWhy are there not a lot of small assignments rather than the few bigger ones? Algorithm and data structure design is best practised not by drill of small questions with no relation to each other or real life, but by tackling bigger assignments, which have been selected as examples of the infinite variety of interesting algorithmic questions that occur in real life.\nWhy are the assignments to be programmed in Python rather than in any language of my choice? We have no resources for offering skeleton programs and simple test cases for more than one programming language. A lot of students prefer those features over the freedom of choice of a programming language. Besides, our semi-automated grading system is language-specific for the same reason: it allows us to grade assignments faster and to dedicate more of the standard time budget to actual teaching.\nWhy do we need to hand in reports in addition to programs? This is an algorithms course and the algorithms underlying your programs have to be analysed, hence a report is needed, as we are not just interested in knowing the complexity you claim your algorithm has, but also in how you made that claim. Also note that this course was chosen in order to fulfil the curriculum goal of the ability to communicate in writing: see the course goals\nWhy do we not get more finegrained feedback on our assignment reports and programs? Our solution sessions are a more rational way to use the standard time budget: we give collective feedback instead of finegrained team-wise feedback. More detailed comments can be obtained orally from the assistants upon appointment.\nWhy do I need to spend so much time on the assignments when they are only worth 2 credits? Any time spent on the assignments reduces the amount of time needed to prepare for the exam, so it pays off.\nC. Exam, Grades, and Credits When will the exam be graded? It was a multiple-choice exam, so why are “the” answers not published right away? The head teacher will first read the starred comments, if any, about the questions in the handed-in answer sheets and then only grade, as such comments may affect his judgement about which answers can be acceptable with full or partial credit. He will grade as soon as he finds the time after getting the answer sheets. Please be patient.\nWhere are model answers to the questions of previous exams? Nowhere, except for the multiple-choice exams. The head teacher does not believe in making such answers available (on-line or otherwise) without discussing solution processes or any alternative correct answers in person at the same time. This is the pedagogical approach taken also for the assignments, where you can contact the assistants for this purpose.\nWill there be algorithm design questions in the exam? Will exam questions be similar to the assignment questions? Algorithmic skills are mostly tested in the assignments. Any algorithms for exam questions will be a handful lines long, but algorithm design experience from the assignments ought to be useful for such exam questions. Analytic skills tested in the assignments also ought to be useful for exam questions.\nWill we have multiple-choice exam questions? The head teacher has the right for any form of examination and decides as he sees fit. Note that a multiple-choice question saves you the time of tidying up your answer notes explaining how you reached your chosen answer. Further, if you think a question is unclear or wrong, then you are free to explain on the answer sheet what your difficulty with the question is and what assumption underlies the answer you have chosen or the other answer you indicate. Also, partial credit can be given to some answers in exceptional circumstances.\nWhat will the exam questions be? What should I focus on when preparing the exam? Try and come to the lectures, as the head teacher makes it very clear there what the most important elements of the course material are.\nI nearly passed the exam. What can I do to avoid taking the next exam? No make-up opportunities will be created for near-passes, as the head teacher evaluates those cases very carefully before announcing the exam results.\nD. Resources, Contact, Help, Ethics, FAQ, Course Evaluations, and Feedback Why do I not get a reply to my emailed query? On working days and hours, you can normally expect a reply within a few hours, provided the question is brief, unanswered in this FAQ, answerable in a short time (and not about programming issues), and sent to all the assistants at the same time.\nAre you interested in additional links to great internet resources? Yes, absolutely! Send us an email with links, and we will add the best ones to the course web-pages.",
