      <description>Overall Structure There are 3 mandatory assignments, to be done in alone, worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits) in total.&#xA;The main objective of the assignments is to exercise the theoretical knowledge gained in the lectures. You are to hand in the code and a report. The code should follow the coding convention and the report must follow the structure and content of the demo report&#xA;For each assignment, the assistants supervise 3 help sessions for troubleshooting in the preparation of your reports.</description>

      <description>There is an individual, written, closed-book exam at the end of the course.&#xA;Some old exams can be found here.&#xA;Expected Effort One higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average student. Hence 133.33 hours are expected on this 5-credit course.&#xA;The exam is worth 3 credits. In addition to the exam preparation performed while working (during 90 hours) for the 2 credits for the assignments the remaining preparation and the taking of the exam are expected to take 24 hours. Recall that 19.5 hours are spent on the 13 lectures.</description>

      <description>Recommended exercises from the CLR3 book for exam preparation. Don’t forget the book is available online at the University library. All these exercises are from the third edition. I don’t have the answers to the questions, and some of the exercises are non-trivial but will give you a deeper understanding of the material in book.&#xA;Chapter 15&#xA;15.1-2 15.1-3 15-2-2 15.4-1 15.4-2 15.4-3 Chapter 16&#xA;16.1-1 16.1-2 16.1-3 16.1-4 Chapter 21</description>

      <description>Assignments The three assignments are worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits). The assignment grade is as follows when $a_i$ is your final score (out of 10) on Assignment $i \in 1..3$, and $a = a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ is your total score. You must earn at least 3 points (of 10) on each assignment until the end of its grading session, including at least 1 point (of 5) on each problem.</description>

      <description>Before contacting anyone for help, please check whether your question has an answer in the FAQ list below. If not:&#xA;If you have a question about the lecture material or course organisation, then contact the head teacher.&#xA;If you have a question about the assignments or infrastructure, then contact the assistants at a help or solution session for an immediate answer. Short clarification questions (that is: not about programming issues) that are emailed to the AD2 helpdesk are answered as soon as possible during working days and hours. No answer means that you should go to a help session: almost all the assistants’ budgeted time is allocated to grading and to the help, grading, and solution sessions.</description>
