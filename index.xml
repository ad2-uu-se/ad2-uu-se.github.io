      <description>Overall Structure There are 3 mandatory assignments, to be done in alone, worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits) in total.
The main objective of the assignments is to exercise the theoretical knowledge gained in the lectures. You are to hand in the code and a report. The code should follow the coding convention and the report must follow the structure and content of the demo report
For each assignment, the assistants supervise 3 help sessions for troubleshooting in the preparation of your reports.</description>

      <description>The main objective of the assignments is to exercise the theoretical knowledge gained in the lectures, on carefully selected problems of our choice. We are not just interested in sufficiently correct and efficient programs, but also in explanations and a runtime analysis, hence a report is also required for each assignment and its quality has an impact on the score for your assignment.
See the demo report and LaTeX source for the imposed document structure and an indication of the expected quality of content.</description>

      <guid>https://ad2-uu-se.github.io/exam/index.html</guid>
      <description>There is an individual, written, closed-book exam at the end of the course.
Some old exams can be found here.
Expected Effort One higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average student. Hence 133.33 hours are expected on this 5-credit course.
The exam is worth 3 credits. In addition to the exam preparation performed while working (during 90 hours) for the 2 credits for the assignments the remaining preparation and the taking of the exam are expected to take 24 hours.</description>

      <description>Recommended exercises from the CLR3 book for exam preparation. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the book is available online at the University library. All these exercises are from the third edition. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the answers to the questions, and some of the exercises are non-trivial but will give you a deeper understanding of the material in book.

      <description>$\sqrt{3}$ Assignments The three assignments are worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits). The assignment grade is as follows when $a_i$ is your final score (out of 10) on Assignment $i \in 1..3$, and $a = a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ is your total score. You must earn at least 3 points (of 10) on each assignment until the end of its grading session, including at least 1 point (of 5) on each problem.</description>

      <description>Before contacting anyone for help, please check whether your question has an answer in the FAQ list below. If not:
If you have a question about the lecture material or course organisation, then contact the head teacher.
If you have a question about the assignments or infrastructure, then contact the assistants at a help or solution session for an immediate answer. Short clarification questions (that is: not about programming issues) that are emailed to the AD2 helpdesk are answered as soon as possible during working days and hours.</description>
