<h1 id="assignments">Assignments</h1>

<h2 id="overall-structure">Overall Structure</h2>
<p>There are 3 mandatory <em>assignments</em>, to be done in
<em>alone</em>, worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS
credits) in total.</p>
<p>The main objective of the assignments is to exercise the theoretical
knowledge gained in the lectures.  You are to hand in the <strong>code</strong> and
a report. The code should follow the <a href="/assignments/codeconv/index.html">coding convention</a> and the report must follow the structure and content
of the <a href="/assignments/demorep/index.html">demo report</a></p>
<p>For each assignment, the <a href="mailto:it-ad2@lists.uu.se" target="_blank">assistants</a>
supervise 3 <em>help sessions</em> for troubleshooting in the preparation of
your reports.</p>
<p>Each assignment has 2 independent problems, each yielding a <em>problem
score</em> in $0..5$, hence there is a maximum of 30 points to earn.  For
each problem, a skeleton code in <a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/" target="_blank">Python
3</a> with  test
cases is provided.  Insufficiently good reports can be defended orally
to an assistant in scheduled <em>grading sessions</em>.  Solutions are
discussed by the assistants in <em>solution sessions</em>.</p>
<h2 id="submission-requirements">Submission Requirements</h2>
<p>You must submit :</p>
<ul>
<li>Your report</li>
<li>All relevant python files. You must not change the API or function
signatures. If you do this, then we cannot run the automated testing
and you will receive a mark of 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>The skeleton code comes with an extensive set of test cases. Your
submitted code must pass <strong>all</strong> test cases. If you code does not pass
all test cases, then we will not read your report and you will receive
a mark of 0 for that part of the assignment. Your implementation
should be correct, and if it is correct then you should be able to
pass all the provided test cases.</p>
<h2 id="help-sessions">Help Sessions</h2>
<p>The objective of a help session is <em>only</em> for the assistants to help
you prepare an acceptable solution for the assignment with the closest
upcoming deadline.  Also, the necessary course material will normally
have been presented in lectures at least a week prior to the first
help session.  You are thus able and even <em>strongly encouraged</em> to
prepare your solution as far as possible until the help sessions and
to attend them, in order to make best use of that reserved time span
of personal attention by the assistants.</p>
<h2 id="solution-session">Solution Session</h2>
<p>The objective of a solution session is <em>only</em> for the assistants to
discuss acceptable solutions to the assignment of the previous
deadline.  <em>No</em> code will be handed out.  The first two solution
sessions are merged with the initial help sessions to the next
assignment.  For timetable reasons, the third assignment has no
solution session.</p>
<p>Comments on your submitted report can be found on Studium; more
detailed comments can be obtained orally from the assistants upon
appointment.</p>
<h2 id="submission-and-deadlines">Submission and Deadlines</h2>
<p>All assignment reports, with <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~justin/Assets/Teaching/AD2/demoReport/demoReport.pdf" target="_blank">imposed
structure</a>
must be submitted electronically via Studium, whose clock may be
different from yours.  Submission deadlines are <em>hard</em>.  Grading will
only start after a deadline, so you can submit multiple times until
then.</p>
<h2 id="ethics">Ethics</h2>
<p>Please see the <a href="/contact/index.html">Ethics Guidelines</a> in the
FAQ.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to give different assignment scores to the
teammates of a team, depending on the performance at the grading
session.</p>
<p>Please report any problems within a team to the head teacher, who
will handle the case in confidence, in the best interest of both
teammates, keeping the ethics dimension in mind.</p>
<h2 id="expected-effort">Expected Effort</h2>
<p>One higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish
university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average
student.  Hence 133.33 hours are expected on this 5-credit course.</p>
<p>The assignments are worth 2 credits in total.  Not counting the
19.5 hours spent on the 13 lectures, <em>the 3 assignments are
calibrated to take an average of 30 hours each, for the average
student, for each teammate, including the corresponding help, grading,
and solution sessions</em>, and this <em>time counts
also as exam preparation</em>.</p>
<p>All this does not clash with other courses you are taking, as
university studies are legally defined to take 400 hours of work per
study period (normally 10 weeks), and the standard 15 credits targeted
in a study period are calibrated to reach that total.</p>
<p>Do not expect the 3 assignments to be equally labour-intensive, and
do not expect the 2 problems of each assignment to be equally
labour-intensive.  Assignment 3 is calibrated somewhat shorter due to
the proximity of the exam.</p>
<h2 id="former-students">Former Students</h2>
<p>Students from previous academic years who have not yet been awarded
the credit point(s) for the assignments contact the head teacher.</p>

<h1 id="coding-convention">Coding Convention</h1>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>All assignments are to be written in <a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/" target="_blank">Python
3</a>. Your assignments
will be partially tested by an automated system, and the exact version
of Python that will be used will be specified on the assignments.</p>
<p>The learning of sufficient Python  skills is <em>within your time budget
for this  course</em>, and this should  not take more than  a couple hours.</p>
<p>We highly recommend you learn or use
<a href="https://www.latex-project.org" target="_blank">LaTex</a> for typesetting your assignment
reports in a professional way, but this is optional.  The learning of
LaTeX is <em>outside</em> your time budget for this course, but very
well-invested as you will find out during the course or
later.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>A program for insertion sort that is fully annotated according to the
coding convention is given on page 3 of the <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~justin/Assets/Teaching/AD2/demoReport/" target="_blank">AD2 demo report</a> which
also contains examples of all LaTeX2e commands you need for this
course.</p>
<h2 id="coding-convention-and-checklist-before-submitting">Coding Convention and Checklist before submitting</h2>
<p>The first two pages of the <a href="https://user.it.uu.se/~justin/Assets/Teaching/AD2/demoReport/demoReport.pdf" target="_blank">AD2 demo
report</a>
contain a checklist that you <em>must</em> follow before submitting and the
coding convention that you <em>must</em> follow.</p>

<h1 id="demo-report">Demo Report</h1>

<p>The main objective of the assignments is to exercise the theoretical
knowledge gained in the lectures, on carefully selected problems of
our choice.  We are not just interested in sufficiently correct and
efficient programs, but also in explanations and a runtime analysis,
hence a report is also required for each assignment and its quality
has an impact on the score for your assignment.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~justin/Assets/Teaching/AD2/demoReport/demoReport.pdf" target="_blank">demo
report</a>
and <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~justin/Assets/Teaching/AD2/demoReport/" target="_blank">LaTeX
source</a>
for the imposed document structure and an indication of the expected
quality of content.  Our expectations are higher than at the exam, as
the aims are to learn something and to prepare for the exam: we expect
at least a high degree of <em>correctness</em>, <em>completeness</em>, and
<em>compliance</em> with the <a href="/assignments/codeconv/index.html">coding convention</a> of this course.</p>
