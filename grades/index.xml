    <description>Assignments The three assignments are worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits). The assignment grade is as follows when $a_i$ is your final score (out of 10) on Assignment $i \in 1..3$, and $a = a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ is your total score. You must earn at least 3 points (of 10) on each assignment until the end of its grading session, including at least 1 point (of 5) on each problem.</description>
