<em>alone</em>, worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS
credits) in total.</p><p>The main objective of the assignments is to exercise the theoretical
knowledge gained in the lectures. You are to hand in the <strong>code</strong> and
a report. The code should follow the <a href=/assignments/codeconv/index.html>coding convention</a> and the report must follow the structure and content
of the <a href=/assignments/demorep/index.html>demo report</a></p><p>For each assignment, the <a href=mailto:it-ad2@lists.uu.se rel=external target=_blank>assistants</a>
supervise 3 <em>help sessions</em> for troubleshooting in the preparation of
your reports.</p><p>Each assignment has 2 independent problems, each yielding a <em>problem
score</em> in $0..5$, hence there is a maximum of 30 points to earn. For
each problem, a skeleton code in <a href=https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/ rel=external target=_blank>Python
3</a> with test
cases is provided. Insufficiently good reports can be defended orally
to an assistant in scheduled <em>grading sessions</em>. Solutions are
discussed by the assistants in <em>solution sessions</em>.</p><h2 id=submission-requirements>Submission Requirements</h2><p>You must submit :</p><ul><li>Your report</li><li>All relevant python files. You must not change the API or function
signatures. If you do this, then we cannot run the automated testing
and you will receive a mark of 0.</li></ul><p>The skeleton code comes with an extensive set of test cases. Your
submitted code must pass <strong>all</strong> test cases. If you code does not pass
all test cases, then we will not read your report and you will receive
a mark of 0 for that part of the assignment. Your implementation
should be correct, and if it is correct then you should be able to
pass all the provided test cases.</p><h2 id=help-sessions>Help Sessions</h2><p>The objective of a help session is <em>only</em> for the assistants to help
you prepare an acceptable solution for the assignment with the closest
upcoming deadline. Also, the necessary course material will normally
have been presented in lectures at least a week prior to the first
help session. You are thus able and even <em>strongly encouraged</em> to
prepare your solution as far as possible until the help sessions and
to attend them, in order to make best use of that reserved time span
of personal attention by the assistants.</p><h2 id=solution-session>Solution Session</h2><p>The objective of a solution session is <em>only</em> for the assistants to
discuss acceptable solutions to the assignment of the previous
deadline. <em>No</em> code will be handed out. The first two solution
sessions are merged with the initial help sessions to the next
assignment. For timetable reasons, the third assignment has no
solution session.</p><p>Comments on your submitted report can be found on Studium; more
detailed comments can be obtained orally from the assistants upon
appointment.</p><h2 id=submission-and-deadlines>Submission and Deadlines</h2><p>All assignment reports, with <a href=http://user.it.uu.se/~justin/Assets/Teaching/AD2/demoReport/demoReport.pdf rel=external target=_blank>imposed
structure</a>
must be submitted electronically via Studium, whose clock may be
different from yours. Submission deadlines are <em>hard</em>. Grading will
only start after a deadline, so you can submit multiple times until
then.</p><h2 id=ethics>Ethics</h2><p>Please see the <a href=/contact/index.html>Ethics Guidelines</a> in the
FAQ.</p><p>We reserve the right to give different assignment scores to the
teammates of a team, depending on the performance at the grading
session.</p><p>Please report any problems within a team to the head teacher, who
will handle the case in confidence, in the best interest of both
teammates, keeping the ethics dimension in mind.</p><h2 id=expected-effort>Expected Effort</h2><p>One higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish
university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average
student. Hence 133.33 hours are expected on this 5-credit course.</p><p>The assignments are worth 2 credits in total. Not counting the
19.5 hours spent on the 13 lectures, <em>the 3 assignments are
calibrated to take an average of 30 hours each, for the average
student, for each teammate, including the corresponding help, grading,
and solution sessions</em>, and this <em>time counts
also as exam preparation</em>.</p><p>All this does not clash with other courses you are taking, as
university studies are legally defined to take 400 hours of work per
study period (normally 10 weeks), and the standard 15 credits targeted
in a study period are calibrated to reach that total.</p><p>Do not expect the 3 assignments to be equally labour-intensive, and
do not expect the 2 problems of each assignment to be equally
labour-intensive. Assignment 3 is calibrated somewhat shorter due to
the proximity of the exam.</p><h2 id=former-students>Former Students</h2><p>Students from previous academic years who have not yet been awarded

final score (out of 10) on Assignment <span class="math align-center">$i \in 1..3$</span>, and <span class="math align-center">$a = a_1 +

10) on each assignment until the end of its grading session, including
at least 1 point (of 5) on each problem.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Grade</th><th>Condition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5</td><td><span class="math align-center">$a \in \\{25\ldots 30\\}$</span></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><span class="math align-center">$a \in \\{20\ldots 24\\}$</span></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><span class="math align-center">$a \in \\{15\ldots 19\\}$</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=exam>Exam</h2><p>The exam is worth 3 higher-education credits (ECTS
credits). The exam is marked out of 20. The exam is constructed in
such a way to have no marks that are fractions of a point.
The following table
gives your grade assignment. Let <span class="math align-center">$e$</span> be your total exam score:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Grade</th><th>Total Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5</td><td><span class="math align-center">$e \in \\{17 \ldots 20\\}$</span></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><span class="math align-center">$e \in \\{14\ldots 16\\}$</span></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><span class="math align-center">$e \in \\{10\ldots 13\\}$</span></td></tr><tr><td>U</td><td><span class="math align-center">$e \in \\{0\ldots 9\\}$</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Note that previous instances of the course and versions of this
web-page had the exam marked out of 30. At some point actual exam was re-scaled
to have 20 questions, with each question being worth 1.5 points. To
get to the original scale some rounding up or down (usually up and in
the student favour) had to be done. This new version of the table is
much simpler and gives the student the same marks as before.</p><h2 id=overall-grade>Overall Grade</h2><p>The overall grade is a weighted sum
as follows when you have earned the assignment
credits with total score <span class="math align-center">$a=a_1+a_2+a_3$</span> (out of 30)
and the exam credits with score <span class="math align-center">$e$</span> (out of 20),
following table gives the overall grade:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Grade</th><th>Condition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5</td><td><span class="math align-center">$2\cdot a + 3\cdot 1.5 \cdot e \in \\{121\ldots 150\\}$</span></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><span class="math align-center">$2\cdot a + 3\cdot 1.5 \cdot e \in \\{96\ldots 120\\}$</span></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><span class="math align-center">$2\cdot a + 3\cdot 1.5 \cdot e \in \\{75\ldots 95\\}$</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Note that you must pass both the assignments and the exam to get a
final grade. If the resulting grade is lower than your exam grade,
then the overall grade is the exam grade.</p><p>Note that the extra factor of <span class="math align-center">$1.5$</span> for the exam grade is to
calibrate a 20 point exam to a 30 point exam. Future version of this

them this year (2020) in order not to confuse students.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=resources>Resources</h1><h2 id=text-book>Text Book</h2><ul><li><p>Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and

Some of the wealthiest people on the planet made their fortunes from
clever algorithms and data structures, witness Sergey Brin and Larry
Page, inventors of the Google web search engine (valued at many
gazillions of sek). Some of the wealthiest people in Sweden studied
at Uppsala University and went on to develop software needing clever
algorithms and data structures, witness some of the founders of OnGame
(acquired by bwin for about 4.5 billion sek), MySQL (acquired by Sun
Microsystems for about 6.3 billion sek), and Skype (acquired by eBay
for at least 17 billion sek). There is no limit to the need for
efficient algorithms and data structures.</p></li><li><p><strong>What are the practical applications of the discussed
algorithms and data structures?</strong> Most batches of slides list a
lot of practical applications. Each algorithm and data structure has
an abstract name so that one does not risk thinking its scope is
restricted to a particular application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why all this theory in the course? Why is it at the
beginning of the course? Is it useful?</strong> In order to discuss
in a scientific way the relative merits of alternative algorithms or
data structures for a given purpose, we need an analytic way of
predicting their performance, rather than experimentally and
inaccurately measuring it in milliseconds or bytes. The (few!)
notions seen are among the most celebrated of computing science and
will transcend the rest of your studies as well as any programmer
career.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why are there not more examples and solved exercises in
lectures?</strong> Like every course, AD2 has a <a href="http://www.uu.se/en/education/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1DL231" rel=external target=_blank>required theoretical
content</a>
(which is <em><strong>not</strong></em> decided by the head teacher) and the standard time
budget (students are 33% fulltime on AD2, and no teacher is anywhere
near fulltime on AD2): the balance of theory and practice in the
lectures simply follows from these data and is not a sign of our bad
will. On the contrary, if allocated more time (but this is
impossible), then we would love to offer additional practical problem
solving sessions.</p></li></ol><h3 id=b-assignments-help-sessions-grading-sessions-and-solution-sessions>B. Assignments, Help Sessions, Grading Sessions, and Solution Sessions</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Why are there not more assistants? Why are there not more
examples and solved / supervised exercises by assistants in lessons?</strong>
Like every course, AD2 has the standard time budget (students are 33%
fulltime on AD2, and no teacher is anywhere near fulltime on AD2): the
number of scheduled events simply follows from these data and is not a
sign of our bad will. On the contrary, if allocated more time (but
this is impossible), then we would love to offer additional practical
problem solving sessions.</p></li><li><p><strong>How do I best use my time, and yours, in order to solve
an assignment?</strong> Prepare your solution as far as possible until
the corresponding help sessions, in order to make best use of that
reserved timespan of personal attention by the assistants. This is
much more effective than going to a help session, printing out the
assignment (which was published at least a week before the first help
session and often does not require any material taught in the
meantime), and not meeting all the difficulties until the end of the
two session hours.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why is there not more email support for the assignments?</strong> We have
scheduled almost all the standard time budget for the lectures, help
sessions, grading sessions, solution sessions, grading, and
preparation. This is why we can only answer to emailed short
questions that trigger brief reply times, and this is a more personal
and rational way of spending the standard time budget: more email
support would inevitably result in fewer help sessions.</p></li><li><p><strong>I am lost! Why do the assignment instructions not tell us <em>how</em>
to solve the questions?</strong> Stating only <em>what</em> output has to be
computed from the inputs is a pedagogical choice. In real-life
engineering problems, you are not asked to solve a problem by using
method <em>m</em> on page <em>p</em> of textbook <em>t</em>. Come to some of the help
sessions of an assignment in order to get advice on what is wrong with
your current solution or get hints on <em>how</em> to proceed. If you think
a programming task is insufficiently described in terms of its pre-
and post-conditions, then contact the teachers: we vet problem
descriptions with utmost care and no flaws are due to purpose or
sloppiness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why are the assignment questions neither in sync with the lecture
contents, nor closer to them?</strong> See the previous question. The
assignment questions are at most within the order of difficulty of the
questions tackled in the lectures, and the lecture material helps in
solving them, but the data structures and algorithms to be designed in
assignments are new compared to the lectures, and they have been
selected as examples of the infinite variety of interesting
algorithmic questions that occur in real life.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why are there not a lot of small assignments rather
than the few bigger ones?</strong> Algorithm and data structure design
is best practised not by drill of small questions with no relation to
each other or real life, but by tackling bigger assignments, which
have been selected as examples of the infinite variety of interesting
algorithmic questions that occur in real life.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why are the assignments to be programmed in Python rather than in
any language of my choice?</strong> We have no resources for offering
skeleton programs and simple test cases for more than one programming
language. A lot of students prefer those features over the freedom of
choice of a programming language. Besides, our semi-automated grading
system is language-specific for the same reason: it allows us to grade
assignments faster and to dedicate more of the standard time budget to
actual teaching.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why do we need to hand in reports in addition to programs?</strong> This
is an algorithms course and the algorithms underlying your programs
have to be analysed, hence a report is needed, as we are not just
interested in knowing the complexity you claim your algorithm has, but
also in <em>how</em> you made that claim. Also note that this course was
chosen in order to fulfil the curriculum goal of the ability to
communicate in writing: see the <a href="http://www.uu.se/en/education/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1DL231" rel=external target=_blank>course goals</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Why do we not get more finegrained feedback on our assignment
reports and programs?</strong> Our solution sessions are a more rational way
to use the standard time budget: we give collective feedback instead
of finegrained team-wise feedback. More detailed comments can be
obtained orally from the <a href=mailto:it-ad2@lists.uu.se>assistants</a> upon
appointment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why do I need to spend so much time on the assignments when they
are only worth 2 credits?</strong> Any time spent on the assignments reduces
the amount of time needed to prepare for the exam, so it pays
off.</p></li></ol><h3 id=c-exam-grades-and-credits>C. Exam, Grades, and Credits</h3><ol><li><p><strong>When will the exam be graded? It was a multiple-choice exam, so
why are &ldquo;the&rdquo; answers not published right away?</strong> The head teacher
will first read the starred comments, if any, about the questions in
the handed-in answer sheets and then only grade, as such comments may
affect his judgement about which answers can be acceptable with full
or partial credit. He will grade as soon as he finds the time after
getting the answer sheets. Please be patient.</p></li><li><p><strong>Where are model answers to the questions of previous exams?</strong>
Nowhere, except for the multiple-choice exams. The head teacher does
not believe in making such answers available (on-line or otherwise)
without discussing solution processes or any alternative correct
answers in person at the same time. This is the pedagogical approach
taken also for the assignments, where you can contact the assistants
for this purpose.</p></li><li><p><strong>Will there be algorithm design questions in the exam? Will exam
questions be similar to the assignment questions?</strong> Algorithmic
skills are mostly tested in the assignments. Any algorithms for exam
questions will be a handful lines long, but algorithm design
experience from the assignments ought to be useful for such exam
questions. Analytic skills tested in the assignments also ought to be
useful for exam questions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Will we have multiple-choice exam questions?</strong> The head teacher
has the right for any form of examination and decides as he sees fit.
Note that a multiple-choice question saves you the time of tidying up
your answer notes explaining how you reached your chosen answer.
Further, if you think a question is unclear or wrong, then you are
free to explain on the answer sheet what your difficulty with the
question is and what assumption underlies the answer you have chosen
or the other answer you indicate. Also, partial credit can be given
to some answers in exceptional circumstances.</p></li><li><p><strong>What will the exam questions be? What should I focus
on when preparing the exam?</strong> Try and come to the lectures, as
the head teacher makes it very clear there what the most important
elements of the course material are.</p></li><li><p><strong>I nearly passed the exam. What can I do to avoid
taking the next exam?</strong> No make-up opportunities will be
created for near-passes, as the head teacher evaluates those cases
very carefully before announcing the exam results.</p></li></ol><h3 id=d-resources-contact-help-ethics-faq-course-evaluations-and-feedback>D.
