      <description>The main objective of the assignments is to exercise the theoretical knowledge gained in the lectures, on carefully selected problems of our choice. We are not just interested in sufficiently correct and efficient programs, but also in explanations and a runtime analysis, hence a report is also required for each assignment and its quality has an impact on the score for your assignment.
See the demo report and LaTeX source for the imposed document structure and an indication of the expected quality of content.</description>
