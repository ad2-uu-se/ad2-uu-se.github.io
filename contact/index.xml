    <description>Before contacting anyone for help, please check whether your question has an answer in the FAQ list below. If not:&#xA;If you have a question about the lecture material or course organisation, then contact the head teacher.&#xA;If you have a question about the assignments or infrastructure, then contact the assistants at a help or solution session for an immediate answer. Short clarification questions (that is: not about programming issues) that are emailed to the AD2 helpdesk are answered as soon as possible during working days and hours. No answer means that you should go to a help session: almost all the assistantsâ€™ budgeted time is allocated to grading and to the help, grading, and solution sessions.</description>
