The main objective of the assignments is to exercise the theoretical knowledge gained in the lectures. You are to hand in the code and a report. The code should follow the coding convention and the report must follow the structure and content of the demo report
For each assignment, the assistants supervise 3 help sessions for troubleshooting in the preparation of your reports.</description></item><item><title>Exam</title><link>https://ad2-uu-se.github.io/exam/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</author><guid>https://ad2-uu-se.github.io/exam/index.html</guid><description>There is an individual, written, closed-book exam at the end of the course.
Some old exams can be found here.
Expected Effort One higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average student. Hence 133.33 hours are expected on this 5-credit course.
The exam is worth 3 credits. In addition to the exam preparation performed while working (during 90 hours) for the 2 credits for the assignments the remaining preparation and the taking of the exam are expected to take 24 hours.</description></item><item><title>Recommended Exercises</title><link>https://ad2-uu-se.github.io/exercises/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</author><guid>https://ad2-uu-se.github.io/exercises/index.html</guid><description>Recommended exercises from the CLR3 book for exam preparation. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the book is available online at the University library. All these exercises are from the third edition. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the answers to the questions, and some of the exercises are non-trivial but will give you a deeper understanding of the material in book.

The assignment grade is as follows when $a_i$ is your final score (out of 10) on Assignment $i \in 1..3$, and $a = a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ is your total score. You must earn at least 3 points (of 10) on each assignment until the end of its grading session, including at least 1 point (of 5) on each problem.</description></item><item><title>Resources</title><link>https://ad2-uu-se.github.io/resources/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2020 11:49:26 +0200</pubDate><author>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</author><guid>https://ad2-uu-se.github.io/resources/index.html</guid><description>Text Book Thomas H.

If not:
If you have a question about the lecture material or course organisation, then contact the head teacher.
If you have a question about the assignments or infrastructure, then contact the assistants at a help or solution session for an immediate answer. Short clarification questions (that is: not about programming issues) that are emailed to the AD2 helpdesk are answered as soon as possible during working days and hours.</description></item></channel></rss>
