The assignment grade is as follows when $a_i$ is your final score (out of 10) on Assignment $i \in 1..3$, and $a = a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ is your total score. Each assignment is divided into two Problems with sub parts. On each of the problems you must have a score of at least 1 (out of 5) to pass the course. If you have a 0 on any of the two problems any assignment, then you will fail the assignments.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-uk</language><managingEditor>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</managingEditor><webMaster>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</webMaster><atom:link href="https://ad2-uu-se.github.io/grades/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
