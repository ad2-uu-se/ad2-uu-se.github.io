    <description>Overall Structure There are 3 mandatory assignments, to be done in alone, worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits) in total.&#xA;The main objective of the assignments is to exercise the theoretical knowledge gained in the lectures. You are to hand in the code and a report. The code should follow the coding convention and the report must follow the structure and content of the demo report&#xA;For each assignment, the assistants supervise 3 help sessions for troubleshooting in the preparation of your reports.</description>

      <description>The main objective of the assignments is to exercise the theoretical knowledge gained in the lectures, on carefully selected problems of our choice. We are not just interested in sufficiently correct and efficient programs, but also in explanations and a runtime analysis, hence a report is also required for each assignment and its quality has an impact on the score for your assignment.&#xA;See the demo report and LaTeX source for the imposed document structure and an indication of the expected quality of content. Our expectations are higher than at the exam, as the aims are to learn something and to prepare for the exam: we expect at least a high degree of correctness, completeness, and compliance with the coding convention of this course.</description>
